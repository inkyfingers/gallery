# Four sources of help in Sugar

Activity Help

Help file in an Activity

Context sensitive help

Social Help

--

Keyboard shortcut **Alt+Shift+H** displays context sensitive help where available.

---

### 1. Help Activity

You will find lots of information in Help Activity.

In Sugar always single click, we never "double click".

--

Help Activity will be found on the Home view.

--

Pressing the Help Activity icon, **resumes** Help.

---

Help Activity opens at the index (or the last page you viewed).

[Help is also available online.](https://help.sugarlabs.org/index.html)

---

### 2. Help file in an Activity

Take, for an example, looking for Help in the [Terminal Activity](term.html).

With the Activity open , press the help icon in the toolbar.

--

A short help file is displayed.

---

### 3. Context sensitive help

Bring in the Frame with the function key F6, or Frame key.

--

Then **right click** on the Terminal Activity icon **in the Frame**, and click on **View Help**.

--

The relevant page from Help Activity is now open in a window within the Terminal.

---

### 4. Social Help

Post questions on an open forum for developers or other users to answer.

Social Help is new for Sugar 0.106, late 2015, don't be shy, please be one of the first to ask!

---

All Activities have a **Stop**, or close, button at top right of the toolbar.
